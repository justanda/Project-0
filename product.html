                Michael J. Fox when he played as Marty McFly in the hit film
                'Back to the Future.' It would have been iconic and a start of

                it from the final release. None the less, it's a great choice of

                It was recorded that Rosa Parks wore this shirt when she first
                sat down on the bus. If Claudette Colvin had worn this shirt
                when she did this nine months prior. Then Rosa Parks would have
                missed being in the spotlight. If you are a civil rights
                activist; this shirt would be a great choice. Every purchase
                supports the BLM movement and additionally raffel ticket will be
                added to your accout. The raffle drawing will be done on Black
                Firday, so keep in touch!
